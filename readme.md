#Vapor Clean

A *lean* template for creating Vapor applications from scratch, with everything you need to make a quick start, and nothing that could have a negative impact on your workflow.

##Usage

First off, head over to the [Vapor](https://github.com/qutheory/vapor) repo to install the latest version of the framework; you can use `curl -sL check.qutheory.io | bash` to verify that your environment is good to go.

Once your environment is configured correctly use the following commands to install the [Vapor Toolbox](https://vapor.readme.io/docs/install-toolbox) and ensure it's up to date:

```
curl -sL toolbox.qutheory.io | bash
vapor self update
```

You can now clone this repo, navigate to the root directory, and execute the following commands:

```
vapor build
vapor run
```

That's it! Over time we'll look to enhance this package so that it has everything you need to start building with Vapor quickly and easily, though always with the aim of giving you only what you need, without all the hassle of having to unpick unnecessary boilerplate code.
